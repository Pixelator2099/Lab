Now that we're Morse code experts, it's time to move on and work on a September 2023 programming challenge.

Write a program that takes in 4 numbers, (xmax, ymax) and (xmin, ymin), where (xmax, ymax)  are the coordinates of a maximum point and (xmin, ymin) are the coordinates of a neighboring minimum point of a sine function and outputs the values of a,f,p and d in the sin function that passes thru these points.
y = a sin(f(x +p)) + d

1. a is amplitude
1. f is frequency
1. p is phase shift 
1. d is displacement
1. Test your program with (-1,5) (3,-1)
